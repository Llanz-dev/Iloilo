        </header>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Dinagyang is a Hiligaynon word that means “merrymaking.” Just like the Sinulog and Ati-Atihan Festivals,
                Dinagyang
                Festival is one of the religious festivities in the Philippines that celebrates the feast of the Santo
                Niño and the pact
                between the Datus and locals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Every 4th Sunday of January, the festival transforms the Iloilo City into a massive street party with
                overflowing drinks
                and food. The most exciting part is that the city hosts a highly competitive Dinagyang Festival dance
                contest and grand
                float parades.</p>

            <h2>Dinagyang Festival History</h2>
            <p class="desc">The Dinagyang festival history started in 1967 when an Augustinian priest from Cebu gave a
                replica image
                of the Santo
                Niño as a birthday gift to a fellow Augustinian priest in Iloilo. Since then, a novena mass was held
                every Friday at the
                San Jose Parish Church.</p>
            <p class="desc">In 1969, a competition was organized similar to the popular Ati-Atihan Festival of Kalibo
                town in Aklan
                province. That
                time, the Dinagyang was known as “Iloilo Ati-Atihan.”</p>
            <p class="desc">“Dinagyang” became the official name almost a decade later when radio broadcaster Pacifico
                Sudario
                insisted on using a
                local word to distinguish the festival from the well-known Ati-Atihan of Kalibo.</p>

    <div class="four">
        <img src="dinagyangPictures/dinagyang4.jpg" alt="dinagyang-img">
        <p class="desc">Another thing to note is that the Dinagyang Festival performances are anchored on a folkloric
            story about the
            Barter of
            Panay. The story revolves around how 10 Bornean datus and their families fled a tyrannical ruler in Borneo
            early in the
            13th century and sailed towards the island of Panay. When they arrived, the Borneans bargained with the
            native Atis to
            occupy the lowlands. To celebrate the barter, the Borneans painted their bodies with soot and danced with
            the Atis.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc">Because of the remarkable celebration, Dinagyang Festival has been famous not just in the
            Philippines, but
            across the
            world.</p>

        <div class="list">

                Instagrammable spots,

            <p><b>2. Bring water</b></p>
            <p>Don’t let yourself dehydrated. Always bring a water bottle with you because for sure, you
                will get tired
                from the
                endless but convivial walks, dances, and parties throughout the day!</p>
            <p><b>Wear appropriate clothes</b></p>
            <p>Comfort is key to a more fun festival experience! Wear clothes that are light and
                comfortable enough for
                you to move
                freely. Also, if you don’t want to have calluses at the end of the day, avoid wearing heels. Choose a
                comfortable but
                tough pair of shoes to keep your feet clean and safe.</p>
            <p><b>4. Wear sunscreen</b></p>
            <p>Unless you want to get a tan, protect your skin from harmful UV rays of the sun by putting
                on sunblock.
            </p>
            <p><b>5. Book your accommodations in Iloilo early</b></p>
            <p>Dinagyang Festival is one of the country’s biggest festivals so expect that many tourists
                around the
                world will visit
                Iloilo during this time. We suggest that you <span>book your accommodations in Iloilo as early as
                    today.</span></p>
            <p>The real Dinagyang Festival meaning is not just about the grand street dance, a parade of
                floats, and
                partying but about
                the celebration in honor of Santo Niño. Through Dinagyang, Ilonggos did not just prove the world how
                artistic Filipinos
                are but also show the values and unity of the community.</p>
