            <h2>Paraw Regatta Festival History</h2>
            <p class="desc">The Paraw regatta is a race among seafarers on colorful sailboats called Paraws in the
                straits between Guimaras Island
                and the city of Iloilo. The present-day paraw managed to maintain its original design from the sailboats
                of the first
                settlers from Borneo who were in search of a peaceful home in 1212 A.D. Surviving the centuries, the
                paraws have become
                a vital part of the Filipino seafaring life.</p>
            <p class="desc">The first race started in 1973 with the mission to preserve the historic value of the
                paraws. It is held every 3rd
                weekend of February at Tatoy’s Manokan, Sto. Nino Sur, Villa, Iloilo City. Today, the event has grown
                from being a boat
                race to a festival with various interesting activities.</p>

        <p class="desc">The Iloilo Paraw Regatta Foundation spent tireless hours organizing the 40th edition of the
            festival. The sailing
            competition and the slew of side events were not just organized simply to entertain and excite. They were
            incorporated
            to the festival to show slices of Ilonggo culture and our love of life and adventure that the rest of the
            world could
            appreciate.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc">Since the dawn of marine travel, the sea has been a constant cradle of inspiration for humanity.
            The sea provides not
            only an almost inexhaustible source of food but offers immeasurable sailing adventures. For many, sailing
            meant freedom,
            and this is why sailing continues to be a persistent passion for mankind, because of its empowering,
            exhilarating,
            challenging and relaxing effects.</p>

            <p><b>2. Bring water</b></p>
            <p>Don’t let yourself dehydrated. Always bring a water bottle with you because for sure, you

                you to move
                freely. Also, if you don’t want to have calluses at the end of the day, avoid wearing heels. Choose a
                comfortable but
                tough pair of shoes to keep your feet clean and safe.</p>
            <p><b>4. Wear sunscreen</b></p>
            <p>Unless you want to get a tan, protect your skin from harmful UV rays of the sun by putting
                on sunblock.
            </p>
